# Questions for the PM

Open product questions. Engineering adds entries here instead of deciding silently. The PM answers inline and moves the entry to Answered. Settled decisions belong in `requirements.md`.

Entry format:

```
### Q<n>: <short title>
- Context: why this came up, with requirement numbers
- Options: the realistic choices
- Recommendation: engineering's pick and why
- Status: open | answered <date>: <answer>
```

## Open

### Q1: Is a modifier-key drop discoverable enough for adding a value?
- Context: Requirement 3. Dropping with a modifier adds a value to a multi-valued property instead of replacing one.
- Options: modifier key only; a visible "add to lane" control on hover; both.
- Recommendation: build the modifier drop in sprint 0 and watch whether testers find it in the user session.
- Status: open

### Q2: Should sequence views show a softer "shares a component" hint?
- Context: Contention is only checked in time views, since sequence steps don't mean items run concurrently.
- Options: no hint; a subtle marker on cards that share a component with a neighbor; a toggle.
- Recommendation: defer until conflict UI exists.
- Status: open

### Q3: How are scenarios forked and named, and can more than two be compared at once?
- Context: Requirements 22–24. The scenario UI is deferred, but the data model is decided in sprint 0.
- Options: pairwise comparison only; one baseline against several.
- Recommendation: pairwise for M1.
- Status: open

### Q4: What happens to cards placed in a view when an axis value is deleted?
- Context: Requirement 27 lets users edit property values, such as removing a release.
- Options: the cards lose that value and move to the holding area; deletion is blocked while cards use the value; the cards move to the parent value in the hierarchy.
- Recommendation: move to the parent value when there is one, otherwise to the holding area. It keeps information and never blocks the user.
- Status: open

### Q8: How does the sequence axis get new columns?
- Context: Requirements 2 and 6, sprint 0 walking skeleton. Sequence is an unlabeled layout position, so there's no fixed list of columns to drop into. This sits at the center of the "drag writes values" bet.
- Options: (a) columns are the distinct sequence values in use, plus a thin drop gutter between columns and at each end, and dropping in a gutter creates a new column; (b) a fixed grid of N columns with empty ones allowed; (c) free horizontal placement with no columns.
- Recommendation: (a). Values are fractional ordering keys, so inserting never renumbers other items, and empty columns disappear on their own. (b) keeps showing empty slots that read as "planned gaps". (c) turns cells into pixel positions, which the requirements rule out ("remembering card positions within a cell").
- Status: open. Building (a) as a reversible default in slice 3.

### Q9: Should cards show their non-axis values in sprint 0?
- Context: Requirement 4 isn't in the sprint 0 deliverables. But the exit criterion is "drag cards and watch values change". Right after a drag in sequence × system, the card doesn't show which quarter it's in, so the only way to check is to pivot.
- Options: no attributes until sprint 1; a minimal badge row (size, quarter, system count); a click-to-inspect panel.
- Recommendation: the minimal badge row. It's small, it's read-only, and testers need it to trust what the drag did.
- Status: open. Building the badge row in slice 3 unless the PM says no.

### Q5: Where do builds go so the PM can click through them?
- Context: The repo is private with no Pages site. The sprint doc asked for a static URL on every merge.
- Options: public repo + GitHub Pages; private + paid Pages; Cloudflare/Netlify previews; local only.
- Recommendation: public + Pages.
- Status: answered 2026-09-26: keep the repo private for now and move to public + Pages later. The PM will sort out private hosting. Until then, CI builds one self-contained HTML file for every PR and `main` push and attaches it as a workflow artifact.

### Q6: Who merges to `main`?
- Status: answered 2026-09-26: engineering merges once CI is green and self-review is done. The PM accepts on the build.

### Q7: In user sessions, who drives?
- Status: answered 2026-09-26: both. The PM demos first, then hands over to testers. The build needs an on-screen legend for gestures, and it has to work in testers' own browsers (the single HTML file can be sent to them directly).
